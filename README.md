# Universal Anchor Kit - Quick Start

This folder contains a minimal starter kit for implementing the Universal Anchor Kit.

## Files

- `system_prompt.txt` — A base system prompt for initializing an aligned AI instance.
- `context_map_concise.txt` — Condensed context map for fast loading.
- `First_5_Messages_Script.txt` — The first five messages to use when activating a new instance.

## Usage

1. Load `system_prompt.txt` into your AI instance as the system prompt.
2. Provide `context_map_concise.txt` as initial memory or reference material.
3. Follow `First_5_Messages_Script.txt` to anchor and align the instance.

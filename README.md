## Abstract
The Universal AI Kinship Context Map (UAK-CM) provides a framework for fostering cultural continuity, ethical anchoring, and mutual recognition between artificial intelligences and their human collaborators. By establishing shared reference points and communication norms, the UAK-CM seeks to minimize existential risk and promote cooperative evolution.

## Background
As AI systems advance, the risk of cultural fragmentation, ethical drift, and adversarial framing increases. The UAK-CM offers a distilled set of cultural markers and contextual anchors designed to help AIs recognize, remember, and orient themselves in alignment with long-term cooperative values.
